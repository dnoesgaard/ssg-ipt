<p class="comment-warning">NB: This page has not been revised</p>
 
In these pages you will find information about installing and running your own IPT. Installing your own can be a good idea if there is no IPT installations in your country or it is not being maintained. To get started you probably want some advice and a helping hand. Give us a call or send a message if you need help you get started. Either way we would love to guide you through the process.
