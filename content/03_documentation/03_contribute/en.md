# Contribute

<p class="comment-warning">NB: This page has not been revised</p>
 
The IPT is an open source project. That means that everyone can contribute. You do not need to be an expert. You can help translating the interface to your local language for example. And if you are a developer missing some functionality we very much welcome pull requests as well. You can find a list of starter issues here to get you familiarized with the IPT. Or you can [file a feature or bug](TODO)
