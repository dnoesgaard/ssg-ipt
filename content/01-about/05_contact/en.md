# Get in touch

_Curious about the IPT but unsure about what to do from here?_ 

<p class="comment-warning">NB: This page has not been revised</p>

Get in contact with us at <mailto:ipt@gbif.org> or contact some of recommended IPT maintainers. There are IPT installations all around the globe and you can probably find some one in your time zone and maybe even someone that speaks your language. 


## Recommended data centers

Bio diversity research is a tough business and ressources as rare as native mammals in New Zealand **(haha very funny - come up with something better kyle)**. Unfortunately that means that many IPTs haven't been online for years or have stopped publishing data altogether.

But some data centers have turned out to be very stable and have a track record of helping publishers getting the most of their data.

** Kyle this should only show the recommened i suppose. Maybe a list with contacts. Possible on the features as well? **
