# Get in contact

_Curious about the IPT but unsure about what to do from here?_ 

Get in contact with us at <mailto:ipt@gbif.org> or contact some of recommended IPT maintainers. There are IPT installations all around the globe and you can probably find some one in your time zone and maybe even someone that speaks your language.

## Recommended data centers
We know that bio diversity research is a tough business and ressources as rare as native mammals in New Zealand. Unfortunately that means that many IPTs haven't been online for years or have stopped publishing data.

But some data centers is very stable and have a track record of helping publishers getting the most of their data.
